# Talk workflow

1. Advise this presentation is experimental

2. Why do we need to experiment with WebLogic on Kubernetes?

3. Why Kubernetes?

4. Kubernetes intro

5. But do we need an orchestrator to scale WebLogic?

6. Use case: 3 layer architecture

UI - Back-end - DB.

Database outside the K8S cluster

UI with Angular o something easy to deploy (maybe play?)

7. Scenarios:

- Single node cluster

How to dockerize a platform?

Turn a Domain into Container Components

Distribute them, show Docker Compose benefits and limits

- Distribute components

Scale Components, move to Kubernetes

Node Manager as orchestrator

- Dynamic clusters

Move to Dynamic Cluster: normal configuration, scenarios with failover,
