# Talk workflow

1. Advise this presentation is experimental

2. Why do we need to experiment with WebLogic on Kubernetes?

3. Why Kubernetes?

4. Kubernetes intro

5. But do we need an orchestrator to scale WebLogic?

6. Use case: 3 layer architecture

Database outside the K8S cluster

UI with Angular o something easy to deploy (maybe play?)

7. Scenarios:
